# smallpt Ray Tracer in C# and F#

C# and F# versions of [Kevin Beason's 99 line ray tracer](http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/).

The C# version is a modified version of [Randy Ridge's C# version](https://github.com/randyridge/smallpt-csharp).

Reassuringly the C# and F# versions run in at very similar speed. F# is only slightly slower.

This was written as an exercise to learn about F# syntax. I was hoping it would be more consise to be honest but maybe there is more syntax for me to learn to make that happen.
